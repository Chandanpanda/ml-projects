#### 1. 1d-convolutional-network-AU-tempuratue-prediction.py 

   1d-convolutional-network-AU-tempuratue-prediction.py includes a 1-d convolutional neural network forecasting model, built with TensorFlow v1.2. The model forecasts Australian    temperature using historical temperature/rainfall. 

#### 2. mobilenetWrapper.cpp, mobilenetWrapper.hpp

  The mobilenetWrapper.cpp & mobilenetWrapper.hpp files include a C++ to Swift wrapper used to implement mobilenet, a deep learning classifier, on an iOS device. The iOS application uploads the pre-built caffe model and runs it using the iOS DNN framework.
