Top public leaderboard score (AUC): 0.78676

### 2. deep-autoregressive-model-tensorflow.ipynb (tensorflow v2)

A formulation for deep autoregressive models was created using the 1st order approximation of the autoregressive function. A deep autoregressive model was created, in TensorFlow, to forecast temperature and rainfall in Melbourne AU. The forecasts were created by snowballing the predictions back into the model. The result showed that the model was capable of capturing small global trends and periodic patterns.

### 3. 1d-convolutional-network-AU-tempuratue-prediction.py (tensorflow v1)

   1d-convolutional-network-AU-tempuratue-prediction.py includes a 1-d convolutional neural network forecasting model, built with TensorFlow v1.2. The model forecasts Australian    temperature using historical temperature/rainfall.
